# Instruction on how to run your script at startup
Let us use Yocto WiFi configuration for automatic connection at boot time as case study
1. The first thing is to add your network setting to wpa_supplicant.conf in
poky/meta/recipes-connectivity/wpa-supplicant/wpa-supplicant.
run 'wpa_passphrase "<ssid>" "<password>"' to generate the psk like this: 

    network={
        ssid="WiFi"
        #psk="xxxx"
        psk=bcc0f1e055c895febe6f4766e90a7972334b2dac4dda015876a185a8bd577a04
    }

2. save this file.
3. The folder that run at startup is /meta/recipes-core/initscripts/initscripts-1.0
create a shell script and call its name setup-wifi.sh.
4.In this newly created script write the following commands;

    #!/bin/sh 

    wpa_passphrase "wifi" "xxxx" >> /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf
    ifup wlan0

    echo "wifi connected successfully"

    #This set the static IP address
    ifconfig wlan0 <ip address>

    exit 0

4. Edit initscript bitbake recipe at  /meta/recipes-core/initscripts/initscripts-1.0.bb
that incorporates the “setup-wifi.sh” and installs it in /etc/initscripts directory after build.

    file://setup-wifi.sh \
    "
    do_install () {
    install -m 0755    ${WORKDIR}/setup-wifi.sh     ${D}${sysconfdir}/init.d

    update-rc.d -r ${D} setup-wifi.sh start 99 2 3 4 5 .
    }

    MASKED_SCRIPTS = " \
    setup-wifi \
    "
